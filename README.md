autoSKU
=======

Automatically assign unique SKU to all your product variations, adding a letter (a, b, c, ...) to the main product SKU.

Tested up to WooCommerce 2.2.10

Respect to other SKU generators, we needed a simple tool that produces a very short SKU code, to be easily written even on a barcode.
